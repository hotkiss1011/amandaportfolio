              I am a front-end developer based in Knoxville, TN with a passion for collaboration and innovation. I currently work at Accenture where I actively participate in the Tech Master program. I love this program because it encourages Accenture employees to learn about all sorts of tech and problem solve in brilliant and innovative ways! In my free time, I love to code and go kayaking when I can (picture of my dad and I kayaking to left).

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I was first introduced to code while working at Accenture. A Tech Master on our team would build <a className="text-indigo-600 underline" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=GUI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUIs</a> for the rest of the team to use and I found it absolutely fascinating! I eventually decided that I had to learn myself and asked him what languages he thought I should learn. This led me to begin learning <a className="text-indigo-600 underline" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VBA</a> to assist my management team with their reports. After that, I began researching languages and specialties, and was drawn to web development. I began learning Python 3 which I was certified in by <a className="text-indigo-600 underline" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a> in November 2020, and later found <a className="text-indigo-600 underline" href="https://shecodes.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SheCodes</a> which has taught me so much! I&apos;ve learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learned about some great tools to make my webpages look great and make coding a bit easier. I have received the SheCodes Basic and SheCodes Pro certifications, and am currently working on getting the SheCodes Responsive certification. I&apos;m so excited to continue my journey and add more to my list of certifications and <a className="text-indigo-600 underline" href="/projects">works</a>.

              I am originally from California where I loved to go to the beach. Carmel has to be my favorite place to visit for the beach and brunch. San Francisco was another favorite of mine. There was a great crepe shop on Pier 39 that you could enjoy before going to see the sea lions or the view of Alcatraz.

              I got my first job at an amusement park called California&apos;s Great America. I began working there in the Games department (most of the games I worked in are now gone üò¢). I eventually was hired as the HR Area Manager of Training and Development where I assisted with interviews, onboarding, and creating orientations that would engage new associates. I met so many great people at this job ‚ù§ (I also learned a lot of great tricks that I can use when playing games at other parks. üòã)
